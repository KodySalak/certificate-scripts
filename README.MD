This repo holds various scripts to fetch keys and certificates
from Certera. As LeGo Certhub development continues, they will
be updated (if needed) to work with LeGo Certhub. They should
also work with any other program that implements the same API.

full-chain-pem.sh is the most generic script

dns_cloudflare contains scripts Certera can call to properly
add and remove ACME dns records on Cloudflare.
